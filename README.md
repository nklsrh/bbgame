ARENA for BlackBerry PlayBook

=============================

A game being designed for the BlackBerry 10 Jam event at Sydney on 12th July, 2012. Built by Nikhil Suresh based on code from the original BLASTR:ARENA game.

Runs fine on recent builds of Webkit-based browsers, such as Chrome. Your experience may vary, as the game targets touch devices.
